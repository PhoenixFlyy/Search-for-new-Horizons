# The Search for Horizon

## The Premise
I am the apprentice of **Aunt Stella**, a brilliant engineer who left Earth 15 years ago on a one-way trip. She left behind a locked **Flight Log**. To open the next chapter, I must physically reach the locations she visited.

## The Mystery
*   Where is she?
*   How did she get there with scrap technology?
*   What did she find in the Outer Rim?

## The Breadcrumbs (Progression)
1.  **Earth (The Backyard):** Found "High-Altitude Hybrid Jet" plans. Clue points to LEO (Low Earth Orbit).
2.  **The Moon (Silent Sea):** Found her rover "The Beetle". Alive plant in stasis. Clue points to Mars.
3.  **Mars (Red Dust):** Found her habitat in a cave. Evidence of fuel refining from ice.
4.  **Outer Rim:** The realization that this is a generic ship.

## Tone
*   **Universal:** No rich background. Just a tinkerer.
*   **Positive:** A rescue/discovery mission, not conquest.
*   **Companion:** A silent robot/pet (Buffa equivalent) to react to G-forces.
