# The Search for Horizon — Story Overview

## The Premise

You are the apprentice of **Aunt Stella** — a brilliant, unconventional aerospace engineer
who left Earth 15 years ago on a self-funded, one-way journey into the Solar System.

She left behind:
- A locked **Flight Log** (her breadcrumb system)
- A half-built aircraft in a garage
- A short, cryptic farewell note: *"Don't stop at the horizon."*

To unlock the next chapter of her log, you must **physically reach** the location she visited.
She anticipated that — she built the clues for someone exactly like you.

## The Mystery

- Where is she now?
- How did she get so far with improvised scrap technology?
- What did she discover in the Outer Rim?
- Did she plan for you to follow — or was the log left by accident?

The tone of each revelation is **optimistic and wonder-filled**, never dark.
She is not dead. She found something extraordinary.

## Tone Pillars

- **Universal:** No rich backstory required. Just a tinkerer with a wrench.
- **Optimistic:** A rescue/discovery mission — not conquest, not survival horror.
- **Grounded:** Real planets, real distances, real physics constraints.
- **Layered:** Each log entry has a simple reading for kids and a deeper subtext for adults.
