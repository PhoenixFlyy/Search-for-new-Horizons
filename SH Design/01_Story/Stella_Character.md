# Aunt Stella — Character Profile

## Who She Is

- **Role:** Your mentor and the emotional core of the game
- **Background:** Self-taught engineer, grew up with very little, never fit the institutional mold
- **Relationship to Player:** Aunt — family, not employer. She believed in you before you believed in yourself.

## Why She Left

She discovered something anomalous in deep space during a late-night amateur telescope session.
She couldn't prove it, couldn't publish it, couldn't get anyone to listen.
So she went herself — incrementally, planet by planet, using technology she invented from scrap.

She didn't disappear. She made a choice.

## Her Voice (Log Entries)

Stella's voice logs are the primary narrative delivery system. They should feel like:
- A brilliant person talking to themselves, not performing for an audience
- Warm, dry humor balanced with deep curiosity
- Range from pure technical notes ("fuel pressure nominal, but the gauge smells burnt")
  to philosophical musings ("I wonder if the word 'away' even means anything out here")

**Two reading layers:**
- *Surface (children):* Adventure, wonder, warmth — "She sounds like she's having fun!"
- *Subtext (adults):* Loneliness, purpose, the cost of following your obsession

3. **Mars log:** She lived here for months — logs become more personal, domestic
4. **Asteroid Belt depot:** She prepared this *for you specifically* — first sign she expected to be followed
5. **Europa log:** She sounds different — on the edge of something
6. **Saturn beacon:** Direct message to you by name. She's been tracking your progress.
7. **Uranus ship:** An audio memoir left in the empty ship — her full story
