## Story & Gameplay loop

Your **Aunt Stella**, a brilliant aerospace engineer, vanished 26 years ago.
She left behind a half-built aircraft, a cryptic flight log, and a trail of clues
stretching from Earth to the outer rim of the Solar System.

You build ships from scrap. You follow her breadcrumbs. Planet by planet,
you uncover what she discovered — and why she never came back.
